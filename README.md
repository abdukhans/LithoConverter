# LithoConverter

## How run this code

This branch is only used to test see if the code works on other peoples machines. Inorder to validate that this code works you must be able to run the Litho_pipeline.py script. The output of this script is a bin_vec.csv file that will be outputted in CWD (current working directory). Inorder for it to run properly it needs the British columbia dataset.

The British Columbia dataset is in the mineral google drive folder:

<pre>/Data/Canada/British Columbia/Lithogeochemical/lithogeochem_data.csv</pre>

It is preferred that this dataset is just in  CWD since that is what the Litho_pipeline.py script assumes. Also since the /LITHO_CSVS folder already has the csvs files generated by 'gen_csvs' this part of the code will not run and therefor running this script will not require open AI api keys. 

For requirements.txt it ONLY includes the libraries that are required for running this script. It is recommended that you create a python venv. When developing this code python 3.10.6 was used but I was able to run these commands with 3.11.1 so just a python version above 3.10.6. Here are the following steps required to run this code:

First step is to download all the required python libraries:

<pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre> 


Next step is to run the following:

<pre>python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('universal_tagset')"</pre>


Then just run: 

<pre>python ./Litho_pipeline.py</pre>


It should just work.
